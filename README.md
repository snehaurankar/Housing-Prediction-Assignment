# DTSE Full-Stack Developer assignment

You are given this repository from the data science team. It contains a Python script that generates a model, stores it in a file and then uses it to generate a house price prediction based on the property parameters.

Your task is to provide an web-based UI that uses this model and generates predictions.

## Task
1.	Create a back-end with REST API that uses the model for predictions.
2.	Create a front-end with a form to accept the house parameters (size, location, number of rooms etc.) as inputs and a "Predict" button. After the button is clicked, the predicted price is fetched from the back-end and displayed to the user.
3.	Add a table to the front-end. Display all the previously computed predictions with a timestamp in this table.
4.	Bonus (optional): Display any valuable data in a single graph on the front-end.

## Submitting your solution
The preferred form of submission is to place the whole solution in a public GitHub repository and send us a link. Both the dataset and model are distributed under the public license. If you don't wish to display your solution publicly, you can send a zip archive with the code to the telekom email address (your contact person).

## Notes
* The back-end does not have to be complicated. No authorization is necessary, but it's nice to have.
* The front-end should be a single page application using the API. After submitting the form, the page should display the data without any reloading.
* Both front-end and back-end can be started locally using a command line. You don't have to create any Dockerfile (but you can!).
* You should not generate any new model. Use the model provided in the `model.joblib` file.
* If you use a database, is should be part of your solution as a file.
* If something is unclear or you run into any technical diffilcuties, feel free to contact us.
* Python 3.9.13 was tested with the solution, thus this version is safe to use. But upgrading the solution to the latest stable python version woudln't hurt eiter.

### Files
* `main.py` - sample script that generates and uses the model
* `model.joblib` - the computed model you should use
* `housing.csv` - data files used to generate the model
* `requirements.txt` - pip dependencies
